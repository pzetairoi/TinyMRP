# TinyMRP
Lean inventory and MRP system based on python

Our project uses a specific configuration file, TinyMRP_conf.xlsm, which should be personalized for each instance of the repository and not tracked by Git to avoid overwriting personal or instance-specific settings. To manage this, we provide a template file, TinyMRP_conf_template.xlsm, which you can customize according to your needs.

# Initial Setup

## Check for the Existing Configuration File:
Before making any changes, ensure you do not already have a TinyMRP_conf.xlsm file that you wish to keep. If you do, make sure it is backed up or stored safely outside the repository folder.

## Copy the Configuration Template:
If TinyMRP_conf.xlsm does not exist or you wish to reset it to the default template, copy TinyMRP_conf_template.xlsm to TinyMRP_conf.xlsm

cp TinyMRP_conf_template.xlsm TinyMRP_conf.xlsm

## Customize Your Configuration:

Open TinyMRP_conf.xlsm in your preferred spreadsheet editor and adjust the settings to fit your local environment or personal preferences.
